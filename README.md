This project analyses the number of rounds won during each half by teams in a match for a video game called Counter Strike: Global Offensive.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them. The match is played on a particular map out of the several available ones. Conventionally, both the teams consist of 5 players each and they start on either the Terrorists (T) side or the Counter-Terrorists (CT) side. There are two halves in each map - 15 rounds each. After the first half, both the teams swap out their respective role to the opposite team. If the team played the T side in the first half, they will play the CT side in the second half and vice versa.
