This project analyses the number of rounds won during each half by teams in a match for a video game called Counter Strike: Global Offensive.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them. The match is played on a particular map out of the several available ones.
